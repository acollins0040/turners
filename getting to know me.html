<strong> <P> I have been a hornet for almost 8 years now, teaching reading for most of those years. I have a husband and 3 children that have also attended Viper! In my free time I love to spend time with my family/animals and read books 
 <p>I received my associates degree from Hazard Community College, with my bachelors coming from Morehead State University. I went on to receive two Masters degrees from University of the Cumberlands in Teacher Leader and Literacy Specialist. I am now working on a third Masters degree to become Library Media Specialist. Books have always been my passion and I have always felt like I was a librarian at heart, so I am beyond blessed to be given the opportunity to fulfull this journey.  <p>
